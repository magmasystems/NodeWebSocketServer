# NodeWebSocketServer

This is an extremely simplistic NodeJS server that pumps out a MSFT quote (the price is a serially-increasing integer) every second.

There is also a small HTML file that shows you how to consume the data from the web socket.

To start the server, run the command `node app`. The server will start on port 3000.

Then bring up the HTML file in Chrome. You will see the quotes ticking every second.

Feel free to use this code to bootstrap your own projects. Comments are always welcome.

Thanks.
